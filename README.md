# Social-VR-Starter-Template
A base template for starting social VR projects.


This is a work in progress.  There will be many bugs here.
It is intended to allow me to start projects fast and add assets to scene.
Has build in networked-aframe Social VR with capabilities for environment, video player, particles, simple-navmesh-constraint.
Best to read my book first.
