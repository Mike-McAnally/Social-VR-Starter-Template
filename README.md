# Social-VR-Starter-Template
My base template for starting Social VR projects.


This is a work in progress!  There will be many bugs here.
It is intended to allow me to start projects fast and add new assets to scenes. No explanation will be given how to use this. 
It has build-in Social VR with capabilities for environment, ocean, 360Â° orbs teleport, blink teleport, video player, particles, simple-navmesh-constraint, physics.
A single fixed avatar head and hands is setup.
Best to read my book and try the other examples first.
