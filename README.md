# Social-VR-Starter-Template
A base template for starting social VR projects.


This is a work in progress.  There will be many bugs here.
It is intended to allow me to start projects fast and add assets to scene. No explanation will be given how to use this. 
Has build in networked-aframe Social VR with capabilities for environment, ocean, 360Â° orbs teleport, blink teleport, video player, particles, simple-navmesh-constraint, physics.
Best to read my book first.
