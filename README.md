# Social-VR-Starter-Template
My base template for starting Social VR projects.


This is a work in progress!  There will be bugs here.
It is intended to allow me to start projects fast and add new assets to scenes. No explanation will be given how to use this. Best to read my book and try the other examples first. 
It has build-in multi-user Social VR with capabilities for environment, ocean, 360Â° orbs teleport, blink teleport, video player, particles, simple-navmesh-constraint, physics.
A single fixed avatar with head and hands is setup.

DEMO:
open two copies of link in seperate (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Meta) browser tabs then,
WASD keys move, left-mouse-drag rotates.  VR headset enabled.  Not ideal for smart phone access, view on desktop/laptop/headset.
